          <p>
            According to the Oxford English Dictionary (yes, you read that
            right! "Meme" was added to the dictionary in 2015!) a meme is "an
            element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to
            be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means,
            especially imitation a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc.,
            that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by
            internet users."
